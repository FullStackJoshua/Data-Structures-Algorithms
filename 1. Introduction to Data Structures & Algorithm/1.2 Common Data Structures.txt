A data structure is a way to organize, manage, and store data in a computer so that it can be 
used efficiently. The choice of data structure impacts how effectively you can perform operations 
like storing, retrieving, and manipulating data.

Key Points:
    Organization: 
        Data structures define how data is arranged in memory (or disk) and how the data is 
        connected. For example, in an array, data is stored in contiguous memory locations, while 
        in a linked list, each piece of data is connected to the next one through pointers.

    Efficiency:    
        Different data structures are designed to be efficient for different operations. 
        For example, arrays are good for quickly accessing elements by their index, while linked 
        lists are better for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list.

Operations: Data structures support specific operations like:
    Insertion: Adding new data.
    Deletion: Removing data.
    Traversal: Accessing each data element in a particular order.
    Searching: Finding a specific element.
    Sorting: Arranging data in a certain order.

Why Data Structures Matter:
    Choosing the right data structure is crucial because it directly affects the performance of your program. 
    For instance, searching for an item in a sorted array is faster than searching for the same item in an 
    unsorted array. Similarly, using a hash table can make lookups almost instantaneous compared to a linear search through a list.

    In summary, a data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps organize and manage 
    data to perform operations efficiently.



1. Arrays (or Lists)
    Description: An array is a collection of elements, typically of the same type, stored in a 
    contiguous block of memory. In Python, a list is a more flexible type of array that can hold
    elements of different types.

    Use Cases: Storing and accessing elements by index, iterating over items.

    Operations:
        Access: O(1)
        Insert/Delete: O(n) (if you need to shift elements)

2. Linked Lists
    Description: A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a 
    reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. There are singly linked lists (each node points to the next node) 
    and doubly linked lists (each node points to both the next and the previous nodes).
    
    Use Cases: Efficient insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle of a list.

    Operations:
        Access: O(n)
        Insert/Delete: O(1) (if you already have a reference to the node)

3. Stacks
    Description: A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
    Elements are added to and removed from the top of the stack.

    Use Cases: Undo functionality, evaluating expressions, backtracking algorithms.

    Operations:
        Push (add): O(1)
        Pop (remove): O(1)
        Peek (view top element): O(1)

4. Queues
    Description: A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. 
    Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

    Use Cases: Task scheduling, managing requests in a network.

    Operations:
        Enqueue (add): O(1)
        Dequeue (remove): O(1)
        Peek (view front element): O(1)

5. Hash Tables (or Dictionaries)
    Description: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup. 
    In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.

    Use Cases: Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs.

    Operations:
        Insert/Update: O(1)
        Lookup: O(1)
        Delete: O(1)

6. Trees
    Description: A tree is a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes forming subtrees. 
    A binary tree is a common type, where each node has at most two children. A binary search tree (BST) is a special 
    kind of binary tree where left children are less than the parent node, and right children are greater.
   
    Use Cases: Representing hierarchical data, searching and sorting data (binary search tree), prefix matching (tries).
   
    Operations (for balanced binary trees like AVL or Red-Black trees):
        Insert: O(log n)
        Search: O(log n)
        Delete: O(log n)

7. Heaps
    Description: A heap is a specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max-heap, the parent 
    node is greater than or equal to its children. In a min-heap, the parent node is less than or equal to its children.

    Use Cases: Implementing priority queues, finding the minimum or maximum element efficiently.

    Operations:
        Insert: O(log n)
        Extract Min/Max: O(log n)
        Peek (view min/max): O(1)

8. Graphs
    Description: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
    
    Use Cases: Modeling networks (social, computer, etc.), shortest path algorithms (like Dijkstra's algorithm), and other complex relationships between data points.
    
    Operations:
        Insert Vertex: O(1)
        Insert Edge: O(1)
        Search (e.g., BFS, DFS): O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges

9. Sets
    Description: A set is a collection of unique elements. In Python, sets are implemented using hash tables.

    Use Cases: Membership testing, removing duplicates from a collection, mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.
    
    Operations:
        Add: O(1)
        Remove: O(1)
        Check membership: O(1)

Summary:
Arrays/Lists: For simple, ordered data.
Linked Lists: For dynamic data with frequent insertions/deletions.
Stacks/Queues: For LIFO/FIFO operations.
Hash Tables: For fast key-value lookups.
Trees/Heaps: For hierarchical data and efficient searching.
Graphs: For complex networks.
Sets: For unique elements and set operations.
Each data structure has its strengths and is suited to specific types of tasks. Understanding these data structures is essential for efficient problem-solving in programming.
